#### Editing already existing content

To edit the content of any existing section, you need to edit its respective _markdown_ (`.md`) file inside the `docs` directory. _Markdown files are the source of the content on the documentation page_. Therefore, modifying an `.md`file will consequently modify the content in the respective section of the docs.

If an issue is opened requesting for a modification to be made in the docs:
  1. `fork` and `clone` this repository
  1. make the necessary changes
  1. submit a pull request
